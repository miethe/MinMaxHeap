# MinMaxHeap
### Built by Nick Miethe

This is my implementation of a MinMaxHeap. The public methods included are as follows:
* a constructor
* boolean isFull()
* boolean isEmpty()
* void insert(int) //inserts int into heap while maintaining structure
* int min()
* int max()
* int deleteMin() //returns min() and deletes from the heap
* int deleteMax() //^ same but with max()
